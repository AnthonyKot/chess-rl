## Usage

### Running the Demo

The chess engine includes a comprehensive demo that showcases all features:

```bash
# Run the demo application
./gradlew :chess-engine:runDemo
```

### Running Tests

The chess engine has 48+ comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality:

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew :chess-engine:jvmTest

# Run tests with detailed output
./gradlew :chess-engine:jvmTest --info

# Clean and run tests
./gradlew :chess-engine:clean :chess-engine:jvmTest
```

### Teacher Dataset Tools

Generate a teacher dataset (NDJSON) via minimax self-play and analyze its diversity.

Collect a dataset:

```bash
./gradlew :chess-engine:runTeacherCollector -Dargs="--collect --games 50 --depth 2 --topk 8 --tau 1.2 --out data/teacher.ndjson"
```

Run the Diversity Report:

```bash
# Default input path: data/teacher.ndjson
./gradlew :chess-engine:runDiversityReport

# With explicit args
./gradlew :chess-engine:runDiversityReport -Dargs="--data data/teacher.ndjson --top 20"
```

#### Diversity Report: What It Shows

- Samples/Games: total rows and unique `game_id`s; average samples per game.
- Side mix: count of `w`/`b` samples; should be roughly balanced in self-play.
- Unique FENs: count and percentage of distinct positions; higher is better diversity.
- Action coverage: unique `best_action` and unique actions appearing in `top_k`.
- Avg `top_k` size: average length of `top_k` per sample (≤ configured K).
- Policy entropy (bits): mean entropy of `teacher_policy`; higher implies more exploratory policies.
- Game max ply: per-game maximum ply (half-moves) stats; many very short or always-capped games can signal issues.
- Top first moves/replies: most frequent moves at ply 0 and ply 1; helps spot opening collapse.
- Most repeated FENs: positions that show up the most; large counts indicate oversampling.

#### Interpreting Results

- Unique FEN ratio: aim for a healthy fraction (for small sets, >60%). If low, add exploration: increase `--topk`, increase `--tau`, add opening noise, or vary `--seed`.
- Policy entropy: near 0 means a peaky, deterministic policy; raise `--tau` or add Dirichlet/ε-greedy noise. Very high with poor play may mean too much noise.
- Opening spread: if a few moves dominate at ply 0/1, inject root noise or randomize the first few plies.
- Repeated FENs: if repeats are high, lower `--max-repeats`, add exploration, or diversify seeds.
- Game length: many very short games may indicate tactical blunders; extremely long games hitting max plies may suggest insufficient winning chances or shallow search.

Tips for more diversity:

- Increase `--topk` (e.g., 8–12) and `--tau` (e.g., 1.1–1.6).
- Randomize seeds per game or per run via `--seed`.
- Add opening noise (random first 2–4 plies) or ε-greedy sampling.
- Consider Dirichlet root noise to broaden openings.

### Basic Usage Examples

#### Creating and Using a Chess Game

```kotlin
import com.chessrl.chess.*

// Create a new game
val game = ChessGame()

// Display the board
println(game.displayBoard())

// Make moves
game.makeMove(Move.fromAlgebraic("e2e4")!!)
game.makeMove(Move.fromAlgebraic("e7e5")!!)

// Show move history
println(game.getMoveHistoryPGN())
```

#### Working with FEN

```kotlin
// Load position from FEN
val board = ChessBoard()
board.fromFEN("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1")

// Convert to FEN
val fen = board.toFEN()
println(fen)
```

#### Board Visualization

```kotlin
val board = ChessBoard()

// ASCII rendering
println(board.toASCII())

// With move highlights
val highlights = setOf(Position(1, 4), Position(3, 4))
println(board.toASCIIWithHighlights(highlights))

// Position analysis
println(board.getPositionDescription())
```

#### Position Validation

```kotlin
// Validate FEN
val result = ChessValidator.validateFEN("rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1")
println(result.getReport())

// Compare positions
val comparison = ChessValidator.comparePositions(fen1, fen2)
println(comparison)
```

## Architecture

The chess engine is designed with a modular architecture:

```
ChessBoard (core board representation)
├── GameState (castling, en passant, etc.)
├── Piece (piece representation)
├── Position (board coordinates)
└── Move (move representation)

ChessGame (game management)
├── ChessBoard (position)
├── MoveHistoryEntry (move tracking)
└── Move validation

ChessValidator (validation utilities)
├── FEN validation
├── Position comparison
└── Error reporting
```

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for:

- Move validation and legal move generation
- Check and checkmate detection
- Advanced chess rules (castling, en passant)
- Integration with AI/ML systems
- Tournament and time control support
- Opening book and endgame tablebase integration

## Dependencies

- Kotlin Multiplatform
- Kotlin Test Framework
- No external dependencies for core functionality

## Platform Support

- ✅ JVM (tested and working)
- ✅ Native (Kotlin/Native support)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

The chess engine is fully functional and ready for integration with the RL framework and neural network components.
