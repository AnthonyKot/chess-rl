# Chess RL Bot

Recent Training Defaults and How to Verify/Roll Back

This augments existing logging improvements; nothing was removed. The notes below summarize what was added, where it lives, how to verify, and how to revert.

Summary of changes
- DQN masking debug logs
  - Code: `rl-framework/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/chessrl/rl/RLAlgorithms.kt` (DQNAlgorithm)
  - Behavior: prints once when masking is set and on first masked target compute
  - Verify in logs:
    - `üß© DQN next-state action masking enabled (provider set)`
    - `üß© DQN masking applied: valid next actions for sample=...`

- Early exploration warmup (first cycles only)
  - Config defaults: `explorationWarmupCycles=2`, `explorationWarmupRate=0.25`
  - Location: `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig` in `integration/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/chessrl/integration/AdvancedSelfPlayTrainingPipeline.kt`
  - Toggle: set `explorationWarmupCycles=0` to disable

- Rollback warmup (skip rollback in first cycles)
  - Config defaults: `rollbackWarmupCycles=2`, `enableModelRollback=true`
  - Location: `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig` (same file)
  - Toggle: set `rollbackWarmupCycles=0` or `enableModelRollback=false`

- Step‚Äëlimit treated as draw (reporting only)
  - Code: `integration/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/chessrl/integration/SelfPlaySystem.kt` in `processBatchResults`
  - Behavior: when `terminationReason == STEP_LIMIT && gameOutcome == ONGOING`, count as `DRAW` in stats
  - Toggle: remove that mapping in `processBatchResults`

- Step‚Äëlimit terminal penalty (training signal)
  - Config default: `stepLimitPenalty = -0.02`
  - Location: `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig` (same file); applied in `performBatchUpdate`
  - Toggle: set `stepLimitPenalty = 0.0`

- Target sync visibility (tip)
  - Default: `targetUpdateFrequency=100` in `integration/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/chessrl/integration/RealChessAgentFactory.kt`
  - For dev runs, you can lower to `20` to surface sync logs sooner

Run & verify
- Basic run (3 cycles, deterministic):
  - `./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 3 --seed 12345"`
  - Look for the two `üß©` lines above and `üìä Self-Play Progress` with non‚Äëzero draw rate.
- Longer run to see trends and possibly a target sync:
  - `./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 6 --seed 12345"`
- Evaluation vs baseline:
  - `./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10"`

How to rollback quickly
- Warmups: set `explorationWarmupCycles=0`, `rollbackWarmupCycles=0` in `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig`.
- Step‚Äëlimit penalty: set `stepLimitPenalty=0.0` in `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig`.
- Step‚Äëlimit reported as draw: edit `SelfPlaySystem.processBatchResults` and remove the STEP_LIMIT‚ÜíDRAW mapping.
- Target sync cadence: restore `targetUpdateFrequency=100` (default) in `RealChessAgentFactory.createRealDQNAgent`.

Production‚Äëminded Kotlin Multiplatform reinforcement learning for chess. It bundles a full chess engine, a neural network package, RL algorithms (DQN + Policy Gradient), and an integration layer with self‚Äëplay, checkpoints, and a baseline opponent.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Practical)

1) Requirements
- JDK 21+ (toolchain targets Java 21)
- Gradle (wrapper provided)

2) Build + test everything
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

3) Train (advanced pipeline)
```bash
# Train 5 cycles
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 5"

# Resume best checkpoint and train 5 more cycles
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 5 --resume-best"

# Deterministic run
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 5 --seed 12345"
```

4) Evaluate vs baseline heuristic
```bash
# Agent vs baseline for 10 games
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10"

# Options
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 20 --colors alternate --seed 42"
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10 --load-best --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/advanced"
```

5) Save/Load checkpoints (JVM)
- Checkpoints are automatically saved during advanced training under `checkpoints/advanced`.
- To start from a specific checkpoint while training:
```bash
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 5 --load checkpoints/advanced/checkpoint_v3.json"
```

6) Monitor progress
- Console shows batch metrics (loss, entropy, grad_norm), evaluation summaries, and checkpoint paths.
- For deeper analysis, see tests: `TrainingDebuggerTest`, `TrainingValidatorTest`.

7) Determinism
- Seeds are centralized via `SeedManager`; NN init, replay sampling, and exploration are seeded.
- Seed metadata is stored in checkpoints; seed summary prints at pipeline startup.

### Traditional (module) test commands
```bash
# Build and run tests
./verify-build.sh                  # Convenience script
./gradlew test                     # All modules

# Useful subsets
./gradlew chess-engine:jvmTest     # Chess engine tests
./gradlew nn-package:jvmTest       # Neural network tests
./gradlew rl-framework:jvmTest     # RL framework tests
./gradlew integration:jvmTest      # Integration tests (pipeline/self‚Äëplay/monitoring)
```

### Performance Benchmarking
```bash
# Compare JVM vs Native performance (JVM is 5-8x faster for training)
./benchmark-performance.sh

# JVM-only benchmarks (works on all platforms)
./benchmark-jvm-only.sh
```
Notes:
- Scripts pin consistent JVM flags (`-Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100`) and record environment metadata to `benchmark-results/**/metadata.txt`.
- Benchmarks include warmup iterations to stabilize JIT/caches and print runtime/hardware details in results.

### Chess Engine Demo
```bash
# Interactive chess engine demonstration
./gradlew :chess-engine:runDemo
```

### CLI (Baseline Evaluation and Training)
```bash
# Evaluate agent vs baseline heuristic for N games (default N=5)
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10"

# Options:
#   --max-steps M                  Limit steps per game (default 200)
#   --colors white|black|alternate Play as White (default), Black, or alternate each game
#   --seed S                       Set deterministic seed
#   --load PATH                    Load a specific checkpoint before evaluating
#   --load-best [--checkpoint-dir DIR] Load latest checkpoint from DIR (default checkpoints/advanced)

# Examples:
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 20 --colors alternate --seed 12345"
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10 --load-best"

# Run advanced training for N cycles (resume best checkpoint if available)
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 3 --resume-best"
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 3 --seed 12345"
```

### Requirements
- **JDK 21+** (required; toolchain targets Java 21)
- **Gradle 8.4+** (included via wrapper)
- **Native toolchain** (optional, for native compilation)

## üéØ Project Goals & Architecture

### Target: Production-Ready Chess RL System (in progress)
- **Advanced Self-Play Training**: Agents learn chess through sophisticated self-play with concurrent game generation
- **Neural Network Integration**: Custom NN library optimized for chess position evaluation and move selection
- **Comprehensive Training Pipeline**: Batch processing, experience replay, validation, and debugging tools
- **Performance Optimized**: JVM-first approach achieving 5-8x faster training than native compilation

### Modular Architecture (4 Packages)
```

```

### Integration Module Is JVM-Only (For Now)
- The `integration` module is configured as Kotlin JVM only to speed up iteration on training and gameplay.
- Kotlin/Native is temporarily disabled for integration to avoid platform API conflicts (e.g., `Thread`, `System`, `String.format`).
- Recommended usage:
  - Build/run only the integration module: `./gradlew :integration:build`
  - Run JVM tests per module: `./gradlew :integration:jvmTest` (or `:nn-package:jvmTest`, `:chess-engine:jvmTest`)
  - Avoid top-level `build` if Native toolchains are present; or exclude native tasks: `./gradlew build -x nativeTest`.

**Design Principles:**
- **Modular & Testable**: Each package independently developed and tested (166+ tests)
- **Performance First**: JVM optimization for training, native compilation for deployment
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive monitoring, validation, and debugging capabilities
- **Extensible**: Clean interfaces supporting multiple RL algorithms and chess variants

## ‚úÖ Status Reality Check

What‚Äôs real today
- Chess engine, NN core (forward/backward, layers, optimizers), integration scaffolding (pipeline, self‚Äëplay controller/system), shared metrics/reporting.
- Seed/Determinism infrastructure and seeded wrappers matching current interfaces.

Important limitations
- DQN: No optimizer step and no target network copy; illegal‚Äëaction masking not applied.
- Policy Gradient: No real optimizer updates; batch training not wired.
- Monitoring/Optimizers: PerformanceMonitor and JVMTrainingOptimizer collect simulated metrics and are not wired into real training loops.
- Serialization: FeedforwardNetwork.save/load is stubbed (load throws).
- Self‚Äëplay ‚Äúconcurrency‚Äù: Batched sequential execution with simulated concurrency.

Near‚Äëterm plan
- Replace simulated metrics with real batch metrics in pipeline (loss/entropy/grad‚Äënorm).  
- Centralize determinism (single run seed), thread through NN init, replay, and exploration; log in checkpoints.  
- Minimal JVM save/load for networks; checkpoint + resume.  
- Illegal‚Äëaction masking in DQN targets; maintain target sync cadence.  
- Standardize logging/metrics and benchmark flags for reproducibility.

- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Robust failure detection, recovery mechanisms, diagnostic tools
- ‚úÖ **Checkpointing**: Model persistence, training state recovery, performance history

#### Lightweight Logger and Metrics Export
- Use `Log` for simple, consistent logs with levels.
```kotlin
import com.chessrl.integration.logging.Log

Log.setLevel(Log.Level.INFO)
Log.info("Starting training‚Ä¶")
Log.debug("Buffer size=\${metrics.experienceBufferSize}")
```

- Standardize and export metrics (CSV/NDJSON) with `MetricsStandardizer` and `MetricsExporter`.
```kotlin
import com.chessrl.integration.metrics.*

val rec = MetricsStandardizer.fromEpisodeMetrics(episode.metrics, tags = mapOf("run" to "expA"))
MetricsExporter.writeCsv("out/metrics.csv", listOf(rec))
MetricsExporter.writeJsonLines("out/metrics.ndjson", listOf(rec), append = true)
```

### üöÄ **Advanced Self-Play Training** (Task 9.2 Complete)

#### Checkpoint Resume Helpers
Use these helpers to restore the main agent from saved checkpoints in the advanced pipeline.

```kotlin
// Initialize advanced pipeline
val pipeline = AdvancedSelfPlayTrainingPipeline()
check(pipeline.initialize())

// Load the best checkpoint found so far (if any)
val loadedBest = pipeline.loadBestCheckpoint()
println("Loaded best checkpoint: $loadedBest")

// Or load a specific checkpoint version
val loadedV5 = pipeline.loadCheckpointVersion(5)
println("Loaded version 5: $loadedV5")

// Continue training after restoring weights
val results = pipeline.runAdvancedTraining(totalCycles = 3)
println("Training resumed. Best model version: ${results.bestModelVersion}")
```

Notes:
- Checkpoints are created automatically (initial, best, periodic) under `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig.checkpointDirectory`.
- On JVM, `FeedforwardNetwork.save/load` uses real file I/O. Native save/load is not yet implemented.

#### DQN Action Masking (Illegal Moves)
Masking ensures DQN targets only consider valid next-state actions when computing `max_a' Q(s', a')`.

Behavior:
- If a provider is set, DQN uses `validNextActions = provider(nextState)` to mask illegal actions in target computation.
- If no provider is set, it falls back to unmasked max over the full action space.

Integration default:
- `ChessTrainingPipeline` automatically sets the provider to `environment::getValidActions`, so masking works out of the box.

Custom environments or manual wiring:
```kotlin
// If you manage the agent/algorithm directly, provide the valid-actions function once.
// Via agent (preferred):
agent.setNextActionProvider { nextState -> myEnv.getValidActions(nextState) }

// Or if you access the underlying DQN algorithm directly:
// (only applicable when your agent exposes it)
// dqn.setNextActionProvider { nextState -> myEnv.getValidActions(nextState) }
```

#### DQN Target Sync Cadence
The DQN target network synchronizes with the main Q-network every `targetUpdateFrequency` updates and logs a short message when it happens.

- Log: `üîÅ DQN target network synchronized at update=<n> (freq=<k>)`
- Configure cadence when constructing DQN (integration defaults to 100):
```kotlin
val dqn = DQNAlgorithm(
    qNetwork = qNet,
    targetNetwork = tgtNet,
    experienceReplay = replay,
    gamma = 0.99,
    targetUpdateFrequency = 200, // sync every 200 updates
    batchSize = 64
)
```
Notes:
- Sync uses a best‚Äëeffort weight copy when the underlying networks support synchronization.
- The log helps verify cadence during debugging and tests.

## üìå Roadmap Snapshot (11.5‚Äì11.13)

- 11.8 Real Metrics [IMPORTANT, medium]: Wire true loss/entropy/grad‚Äënorm from batch training into pipeline; remove simulated metrics. DoD: pipeline reports match algorithm outputs; values are finite and trend meaningfully.
- 11.5 Determinism [IMPORTANT, fast]: Single run seed; thread through NN init, replay sampling, exploration; log with checkpoints. DoD: deterministic test mode and documented seed handling.
- 11.9 Checkpointing (JVM) [IMPORTANT, medium]: Implement FeedforwardNetwork save/load (config + weights) and integrate with CheckpointManager. DoD: save‚Üíload roundtrip and resume training.
- 11.11 Buffer API Cleanup [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Remove duplicate agent buffer for off‚Äëpolicy; use algorithm replay as source of truth; keep per‚Äëepisode buffer only for on‚Äëpolicy. DoD: no duplicate growth paths.
- 11.6 Logging & Metrics [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Lightweight logger + standardized metric keys/units; optional CSV/JSON dumps. DoD: consistent logs and exportable snapshots.
- 11.7 Benchmark Standardization [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Pin JVM flags, add warmup, record HW/JDK metadata. DoD: reproducible outputs with metadata.
- 11.12 Safety Checks [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Stronger require/check on dims, masks, rewards; fail fast. DoD: clearer errors in edge cases.
- 11.13 Baseline Opponent [ADDITION, medium]: Simple material+mobility heuristic for evaluation runs. DoD: baseline win/draw/loss metrics separate from self‚Äëplay.

Notes
- We trimmed legacy UI/demo tests and added fast smoke tests (DQN learning, invalid‚Äëaction penalty). Performance tests are scaled down for CI.
## üß≠ End‚Äëto‚ÄëEnd Guide (E2E)

1) Prereqs
- Install JDK 17+ and ensure `java -version` works.
- Optional: deterministic runs ‚Äî set a master seed in your code using `SeedManager.initializeWithSeed(12345L)`.

2) Build and test
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

3) Start training (advanced pipeline)
```bash
# Initialize and train for 5 cycles
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 5"
```

4) Checkpoints and resume
- Checkpoints are written under `checkpoints/advanced` by default (configurable in `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig`).
- To resume training from the best checkpoint:
```bash
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--train-advanced --cycles 5 --resume-best"
```

5) Evaluate vs baseline heuristic opponent
```bash
# Quick evaluation: agent vs baseline
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10"

# With options
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 20 --colors alternate --seed 12345"
./gradlew :integration:runCli --args="--eval-baseline --games 10 --load-best --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/advanced"
```
- Output includes JSON-like summary with `games`, `avg_reward`, `win_rate`, etc.

6) Monitor and debug (optional)
- Pipelines print batch metrics (loss, entropy, grad_norm) and validation insights.
- Use tests like `TrainingDebuggerTest` and `TrainingValidatorTest` as usage examples for deeper analysis.

7) Determinism notes
- Seeds are centralized via `SeedManager`; NN init, replay sampling, and exploration are seeded.
- Seed metadata is saved in checkpoint metadata; logs include a seed summary at startup.

8) Saving and progress control
- Checkpoints are created at cycle boundaries; best checkpoints are auto‚Äëtracked.
- Advanced pipeline supports pause/resume via methods; CLI exposes basic train/evaluate flows.
- To load a specific checkpoint when training: `--load PATH`
TODO ‚Äì Training appears non‚Äëprogressing (needs fixes)

Observed during Advanced Self‚ÄëPlay run:
- All self‚Äëplay games hit the step limit (avg length ~200), with 0% wins/draws recorded.
- Batch training metrics show near‚Äëconstant high entropy (~8.27 ‚âà ln(4096)) and tiny gradients, indicating a near‚Äëuniform policy and ineffective updates.
- Final ‚Äúbest performance‚Äù remains 0.0, and model rollback selects the initial checkpoint.

Likely root causes and fixes:
- Missing DQN next‚Äëstate action masking: DQN targets should only consider Q‚Äëvalues over valid next actions. Without masking, targets can be dominated by invalid actions, flattening learning. FIX: Provide `mainAgent.setNextActionProvider(environment::getValidActions)` so DQN masks next‚Äëstate Q‚Äëvalues. (Wired in AdvancedSelfPlayTrainingPipeline.)
- Sparse/undirected rewards: With only terminal rewards and high step limits, random play rarely reaches terminal states. Consider enabling positional shaping (`enablePositionRewards=true`) or adding a modest step penalty/bonus to encourage progress. Also consider reducing `maxStepsPerGame` initially.
- Decisive outcomes: Persistently reaching the step limit suggests random play rarely mates or stalemates within 200 moves. Consider early‚Äëdraw adjudication, simpler opponents, or curriculum (smaller boards/opening book) to produce decisive signals early.
- Policy still near‚Äëuniform: Entropy ‚âà ln(4096) implies the network outputs remain effectively uniform. Verify that the network output size matches the action space (4096) and that batch sizes/learning rate are reasonable. Try smaller hidden layers or pretraining with supervised move datasets to bootstrap.
- Metric simulation vs. real updates: Ensure all training metrics reflect real agent updates (they do via `agent.trainBatch`), and that the same agent is used for self‚Äëplay. Keep `setNextActionProvider` wired for both DQN batch training and any evaluation flows.

Next steps (high priority):
- Start with smaller `maxStepsPerGame` (e.g., 80‚Äì100), enable `enablePositionRewards`, and confirm win/draw rates become non‚Äëzero.
- Verify `getValidActions(nextState)` masking is applied (already wired) by logging DQN target syncs and loss trending down.
- Consider curriculum: begin from mid‚Äëgame or reduced action candidates to accelerate learning signals.
