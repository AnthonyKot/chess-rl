- **Result**: Accurate reward signals for RL training

## 📊 Key Features

### **Advanced Self-Play Training**
- **Concurrent Games**: 1-8 parallel self-play games for faster training
- **Smart Evaluation**: Head-to-head model comparison with realistic outcomes
- **Adaptive Scheduling**: Dynamic adjustment of games per cycle based on performance

### **Production-Ready Pipeline**
- **Checkpointing**: Automatic model versioning with rollback capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and performance tracking
- **Validation**: Comprehensive training issue detection and recovery

### **Optimized Performance**
- **JVM-First**: 5-8x faster training than native compilation
- **Memory Efficient**: Handles 50K+ experiences with circular buffers
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for 32-128 batch sizes

## 🎮 Training Profiles

### **Default Profile: `dqn_unlock_elo_prioritized`**
Optimized for learning from scratch with anti-draw measures:
```bash
./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--train-advanced --cycles 10 --profile dqn_unlock_elo_prioritized"
```

### **Bootstrap Profile: `dqn_imitation_bootstrap`**
Start from supervised learning for faster progress:
```bash
# First, collect teacher data
./gradlew :chess-engine:runTeacherCollector -Dargs="--collect --games 50 --depth 2 --out data/teacher.ndjson"

# Train imitation model
./gradlew :chess-engine:runImitationTrainer -Dargs="--train-imitation --data data/teacher.ndjson --out data/imitation_qnet.json"

# Fine-tune with RL
./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--train-advanced --cycles 10 --profile dqn_imitation_bootstrap"
```

## 🧪 Evaluate and Play

### Evaluate vs Baseline (agent perspective)
```bash
# Auto-load best from the profile's checkpoint directory
./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--eval-baseline --games 100 --colors alternate --max-steps 120 --eval-epsilon 0.0 --draw-reward 0.0 --load-best --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/unlock_elo_prioritized"
```

### Head-to-Head (A vs B)
```bash
./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--eval-h2h --games 100 --max-steps 180 --eval-epsilon 0.05 \
  --loadA checkpoints/unlock_elo_prioritized/best_qnet.json \
  --loadB checkpoints/unlock_prioritized_warm/best_qnet.json \
  --local-threefold --threefold-threshold 3 \
  --adjudicate --resign-material 9 --no-progress-plies 40 \
  --dump-draws --dump-limit 3"
```
Notes:
- Strict legal-move masking is enforced; invalid moves should be 0 once models load.
- `--adjudicate` ends games early on large material deficit (default ≥9) or no capture/check for Y plies (default 40). This cuts long “other” draws.

### Play Against the Agent (human)
```bash
# Auto-load best and play as White
./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--play-human --as white --load-best --checkpoint-dir checkpoints/unlock_elo_prioritized"
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Concurrency Settings**
```bash
# Use N parallel self-play games (scales with CPU cores)
--concurrency 8
```

### **Reproducible Training**
```bash
# Use deterministic seeding for reproducible results
--seed 12345
```

### **Custom Checkpointing**
```bash
# Save to custom directory with specific intervals
--checkpoint-dir my_experiment --checkpoint-interval 5
```

### **Task 1: Reward Signal Integration** ✅

**Problem**: Reward signals were disconnected from actual chess outcomes, leading to poor learning signals.

**Solution**: Comprehensive reward system integration with chess-specific shaping.

```kotlin
// Enhanced reward configuration with chess-specific shaping
val rewardConfig = ChessRewardConfig(
    winReward = 1.0,
    lossReward = -1.0,
    drawReward = -0.1,           // Slight penalty to encourage decisive play
    stepPenalty = -0.002,        // Efficiency incentive
    stepLimitPenalty = -0.1,     // Strong penalty for hitting step limits
    enablePositionRewards = false, // Keep simple for initial training
    gameLengthNormalization = true,
    enableEarlyAdjudication = true,
    resignMaterialThreshold = 8,  // Resign when down 8+ points
    noProgressPlies = 50         // Adjudicate after 50 plies without progress
)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Chess-Aware Rewards**: Proper terminal rewards based on actual game outcomes
- **Anti-Draw Measures**: Penalties for repetitive play and step limits
- **Early Adjudication**: Automatic game termination for hopeless positions
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 15+ test scenarios validating reward integration

**Results**: Agents now receive proper learning signals, leading to more decisive play and faster convergence.

**Solution**: Complete overhaul of game state detection with comprehensive validation.

```kotlin
// Fixed game state detection with proper chess rules
class ChessEnvironment {
    fun step(action: Int): StepResult {
        // Execute move and update board state
        val moveResult = board.makeMove(move)
        
        // Proper termination detection
        val gameStatus = when {
            board.isCheckmate() -> if (board.getActiveColor() == PieceColor.WHITE) 
                GameStatus.BLACK_WINS else GameStatus.WHITE_WINS
            board.isStalemate() -> GameStatus.DRAW_STALEMATE
            board.isInsufficientMaterial() -> GameStatus.DRAW_INSUFFICIENT_MATERIAL
            board.isThreefoldRepetition() -> GameStatus.DRAW_THREEFOLD_REPETITION
            board.isFiftyMoveRule() -> GameStatus.DRAW_FIFTY_MOVE_RULE
            stepCount >= maxSteps -> GameStatus.ONGOING // Not a draw!
            else -> GameStatus.ONGOING
        }
        
        return StepResult(
            nextState = encodeState(),
            reward = calculateReward(gameStatus),
            done = gameStatus != GameStatus.ONGOING,
            info = mapOf("game_status" to gameStatus.name)
        )
    }
}
```

**Before Fix**:
```
📊 Game outcomes: {"draw":98, "other":2}
📊 Draw details: {"other":98, "stalemate":0, "threefold":0}
```

**After Fix**:
```
📊 Game outcomes: {"WHITE_WINS":2, "BLACK_WINS":1, "DRAW":2}

            enableExperienceCompression = true,
            adaptiveScalingEnabled = true
        )
        
        for (cycle in 1..totalCycles) {
            // Scaled self-play with adaptive parameters
            val results = executeScaledTrainingCycle(
                cycle, mainAgent, opponentAgent, 
                scaledSelfPlaySystem, robustValidator, 
                scaledExperienceManager, performanceMonitor
            )
