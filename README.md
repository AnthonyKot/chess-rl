```

### Integration Module Is JVM-Only (For Now)
- The `integration` module is configured as Kotlin JVM only to speed up iteration on training and gameplay.
- Kotlin/Native is temporarily disabled for integration to avoid platform API conflicts (e.g., `Thread`, `System`, `String.format`).
- Recommended usage:
  - Build/run only the integration module: `./gradlew :integration:build`
  - Run JVM tests per module: `./gradlew :integration:jvmTest` (or `:nn-package:jvmTest`, `:chess-engine:jvmTest`)
  - Avoid top-level `build` if Native toolchains are present; or exclude native tasks: `./gradlew build -x nativeTest`.

### Profile-based Training and Warm Start
- Profiles live in `integration/profiles.yaml` and can be selected with `--profile NAME`.
- Imitation bootstrap profile (loads a saved supervised model and tunes DQN settings for faster visible progress):
  - `./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--train-advanced --cycles 3 --profile dqn_imitation_bootstrap"`
- Explicitly override the model path:
  - `./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--train-advanced --cycles 3 --profile dqn_imitation_bootstrap --load data/imitation_qnet.json"`
- Collect teacher data and train imitation model:
  - Collect: `./gradlew :chess-engine:runTeacherCollector -Dargs="--collect --games 50 --depth 2 --topk 5 --tau 1.0 --out data/teacher.ndjson"`
  - Train: `./gradlew :chess-engine:runImitationTrainer -Dargs="--train-imitation --data data/teacher.ndjson --epochs 3 --batch 64 --lr 0.001 --smooth 0.05 --val-split 0.10 --out data/imitation_qnet.json"`

### Non‚ÄëNN Evaluation: Minimax vs Heuristic
- You can pit two non‚ÄëNN opponents against each other for fast, deterministic baselines:
  - Minimax (White) vs Heuristic (Black):
    - `./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--eval-non-nn --white minimax --black heuristic --games 50 --max-steps 200 --depth 2 --topk 5 --tau 1.0"`
  - Heuristic (White) vs Minimax (Black):
    - `./gradlew :integration:runCli -Dargs="--eval-non-nn --white heuristic --black minimax --games 50 --max-steps 200 --depth 2"`
  - Notes:
    - Pass `--seed S` to the CLI for reproducible runs.
    - The Minimax teacher and Baseline heuristic live in different modules; this mode runs them head‚Äëto‚Äëhead inside the integration environment.

**Design Principles:**
- **Modular & Testable**: Each package independently developed and tested (166+ tests)
- **Performance First**: JVM optimization for training, native compilation for deployment
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive monitoring, validation, and debugging capabilities
- **Extensible**: Clean interfaces supporting multiple RL algorithms and chess variants

## ‚úÖ Status Reality Check

What‚Äôs real today
- DQN with optimizer steps, target network synchronization, and valid‚Äëaction masking for next‚Äëstate targets (logged with ‚Äúüß©‚Äù).
- Parallel self‚Äëplay on JVM (fixed thread pool per batch); agent calls synchronized for thread safety.
- Deterministic seeding threaded through NN init, exploration, and replay; seeds logged in checkpoints.
- Checkpointing with retention policy (keep best/last N/every N‚Äëth); configurable frequency and cleanup.
- Profiles and CLI overrides for common workflows (DQN vs PG, concurrency, checkpoint cadence, retention).

Known limitations
- Per‚Äëstate masking caveat for replay: `getValidActions(state)` uses the live env board, not the passed state; exact masking for replay would require decode or per‚Äëexperience masks.
- Monitoring: PerformanceMonitor/JVMTrainingOptimizer still produce simulated metrics; real timings aren‚Äôt wired into hot paths yet.
- Compression: Checkpoints use `.json.gz` extension, but content is JSON (no gzip on JVM yet).
- Opponent variety: Limited; richer opponent strategies can improve robustness.

Practical improvements (prioritized)
- Top tier
  - Shorten games (80‚Äì100) and add a small step‚Äëlimit penalty to increase reward variance.
  - Enable positional reward shaping early to reduce sparsity; dial down later.
  - Keep valid‚Äëaction masking on and verify the ‚Äúüß©‚Äù logs once per run.
  - Use parallel self‚Äëplay (set `maxConcurrentGames‚âàcores`).
  - Use deterministic seeds for reproducible comparisons.
  - Set checkpoint frequency/retention to avoid clutter and ease rollbacks.
  - Tune DQN target sync (e.g., 100 default; 20 for debug visibility).

- Second tier
  - Maintain experience quality filtering; tune thresholds; expand chess‚Äëspecific features over time.
  - Evaluate vs baseline heuristic to track win/draw/loss independent of self‚Äëplay.
  - Early exploration warmup and rollback warmup for the first cycles.
  - Treat step‚Äëlimit as draw for reporting (toggleable per profile).

- Solid engineering practices
  - Batch size ~64, Adam + HuberLoss, ReLU hidden layers.
  - Cyclic buffers, preallocation; consider array pooling only if profiling shows churn.
  - Replace simulated monitoring with real timings around NN forward/backward/train, replay sampling, and move generation.
  - Lean on profiles + CLI overrides for repeatable experiments.

Log.setLevel(Log.Level.INFO)
Log.info("Starting training‚Ä¶")
Log.debug("Buffer size=\${metrics.experienceBufferSize}")
```

- Standardize and export metrics (CSV/NDJSON) with `MetricsStandardizer` and `MetricsExporter`.
```kotlin
import com.chessrl.integration.metrics.*

val rec = MetricsStandardizer.fromEpisodeMetrics(episode.metrics, tags = mapOf("run" to "expA"))
MetricsExporter.writeCsv("out/metrics.csv", listOf(rec))
MetricsExporter.writeJsonLines("out/metrics.ndjson", listOf(rec), append = true)

#### Checkpoint Resume Helpers
Use these helpers to restore the main agent from saved checkpoints in the advanced pipeline.

```kotlin
// Initialize advanced pipeline
val pipeline = AdvancedSelfPlayTrainingPipeline()
check(pipeline.initialize())

// Load the best checkpoint found so far (if any)
val loadedBest = pipeline.loadBestCheckpoint()
println("Loaded best checkpoint: $loadedBest")

// Or load a specific checkpoint version
val loadedV5 = pipeline.loadCheckpointVersion(5)
println("Loaded version 5: $loadedV5")

// Continue training after restoring weights
val results = pipeline.runAdvancedTraining(totalCycles = 3)
println("Training resumed. Best model version: ${results.bestModelVersion}")
```

Notes:
- Checkpoints are created automatically (initial, best, periodic) under `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig.checkpointDirectory`.
- On JVM, `FeedforwardNetwork.save/load` uses real file I/O. Native save/load is not yet implemented.

#### DQN Action Masking (Illegal Moves)
Masking ensures DQN targets only consider valid next-state actions when computing `max_a' Q(s', a')`.

Behavior:
- If a provider is set, DQN uses `validNextActions = provider(nextState)` to mask illegal actions in target computation.
- If no provider is set, it falls back to unmasked max over the full action space.

Integration default:
- `ChessTrainingPipeline` automatically sets the provider to `environment::getValidActions`, so masking works out of the box.

Custom environments or manual wiring:
```kotlin
// If you manage the agent/algorithm directly, provide the valid-actions function once.
// Via agent (preferred):
agent.setNextActionProvider { nextState -> myEnv.getValidActions(nextState) }

// Or if you access the underlying DQN algorithm directly:
// (only applicable when your agent exposes it)
// dqn.setNextActionProvider { nextState -> myEnv.getValidActions(nextState) }
```

#### DQN Target Sync Cadence
The DQN target network synchronizes with the main Q-network every `targetUpdateFrequency` updates and logs a short message when it happens.

- Log: `üîÅ DQN target network synchronized at update=<n> (freq=<k>)`
- Configure cadence when constructing DQN (integration defaults to 100):
```kotlin
val dqn = DQNAlgorithm(
    qNetwork = qNet,
    targetNetwork = tgtNet,
    experienceReplay = replay,
    gamma = 0.99,
    targetUpdateFrequency = 200, // sync every 200 updates
    batchSize = 64
)
```
Notes:
- Sync uses a best‚Äëeffort weight copy when the underlying networks support synchronization.
- The log helps verify cadence during debugging and tests.

## üìä Performance Characteristics

### **JVM vs Native Performance Analysis**
Based on comprehensive benchmarking across all components:

**üèÜ JVM Target (Recommended for Training):**
- **5-8x faster** for sustained RL training workloads
- **JIT optimization** benefits long-running training sessions  
- **Better memory management** for large experience buffers (50K+ experiences)
- **Optimal for production ML training** with batch processing

**‚ö° Native Target (Excellent for Deployment):**
- **4.4x faster** for short test suites and CI/CD pipelines
- **Immediate execution** without JVM warm-up time
- **Predictable performance** for deployment scenarios
- **Smaller memory footprint** for production inference

### **Training Performance Metrics**
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for 32-128 batch sizes with efficient memory usage
- **Experience Collection**: Handles 50K+ experiences with circular buffer management
- **Memory Usage**: ~100-500MB depending on configuration and buffer size
- **Throughput**: ~5-7 episodes per second in test configurations
- **Concurrent Training**: Support for 1-8 parallel self-play games (Task 9)


Likely root causes and fixes:
- Missing DQN next‚Äëstate action masking: DQN targets should only consider Q‚Äëvalues over valid next actions. Without masking, targets can be dominated by invalid actions, flattening learning. FIX: Provide `mainAgent.setNextActionProvider(environment::getValidActions)` so DQN masks next‚Äëstate Q‚Äëvalues. (Wired in AdvancedSelfPlayTrainingPipeline.)
- Sparse/undirected rewards: With only terminal rewards and high step limits, random play rarely reaches terminal states. Consider enabling positional shaping (`enablePositionRewards=true`) or adding a modest step penalty/bonus to encourage progress. Also consider reducing `maxStepsPerGame` initially.
- Decisive outcomes: Persistently reaching the step limit suggests random play rarely mates or stalemates within 200 moves. Consider early‚Äëdraw adjudication, simpler opponents, or curriculum (smaller boards/opening book) to produce decisive signals early.
- Policy still near‚Äëuniform: Entropy ‚âà ln(4096) implies the network outputs remain effectively uniform. Verify that the network output size matches the action space (4096) and that batch sizes/learning rate are reasonable. Try smaller hidden layers or pretraining with supervised move datasets to bootstrap.
- Metric simulation vs. real updates: Ensure all training metrics reflect real agent updates (they do via `agent.trainBatch`), and that the same agent is used for self‚Äëplay. Keep `setNextActionProvider` wired for both DQN batch training and any evaluation flows.

Next steps (high priority):
- Start with smaller `maxStepsPerGame` (e.g., 80‚Äì100), enable `enablePositionRewards`, and confirm win/draw rates become non‚Äëzero.
- Verify `getValidActions(nextState)` masking is applied (already wired) by logging DQN target syncs and loss trending down.
- Consider curriculum: begin from mid‚Äëgame or reduced action candidates to accelerate learning signals.
