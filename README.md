# Chess RL Bot

A Kotlin Multiplatform reinforcement learning chess project. It includes a full chess engine, a neural network package, an RL framework, and an integration layer for self-play and training.

Repo Sync Update ‚Äî 2025-09-14
- Reality check: Parts of the optimization/monitoring stack are simulated and not wired to real training yet. DQN/PG algorithms do not apply optimizer updates; target network sync and illegal‚Äëaction masking are not implemented. Model save/load is stubbed.
- What‚Äôs real: Chess engine, NN core, self‚Äëplay result models, training pipeline scaffold, seeded components, metrics/reporting types.
- Short‚Äëterm fixes queued: align monitoring API usage, patch minor syntax, and then implement a minimal batch train path and DQN target sync/masking.

## üöÄ How to Run and Test

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build and run tests
./verify-build.sh                  # Convenience script
./gradlew test                     # All modules

# Useful subsets
./gradlew chess-engine:jvmTest     # Chess engine tests
./gradlew nn-package:jvmTest       # Neural network tests
./gradlew rl-framework:jvmTest     # RL framework tests
./gradlew integration:jvmTest      # Integration tests (pipeline/self‚Äëplay/monitoring)
```

### Performance Benchmarking
```bash
# Compare JVM vs Native performance (JVM is 5-8x faster for training)
./benchmark-performance.sh

# JVM-only benchmarks (works on all platforms)
./benchmark-jvm-only.sh
```
Notes:
- Scripts pin consistent JVM flags (`-Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100`) and record environment metadata to `benchmark-results/**/metadata.txt`.
- Benchmarks include warmup iterations to stabilize JIT/caches and print runtime/hardware details in results.

## ‚úÖ Status Reality Check

What‚Äôs real today
- Chess engine, NN core (forward/backward, layers, optimizers), integration scaffolding (pipeline, self‚Äëplay controller/system), shared metrics/reporting.
- Seed/Determinism infrastructure and seeded wrappers matching current interfaces.

Important limitations
- DQN: No optimizer step and no target network copy; illegal‚Äëaction masking not applied.
- Policy Gradient: No real optimizer updates; batch training not wired.
- Monitoring/Optimizers: PerformanceMonitor and JVMTrainingOptimizer collect simulated metrics and are not wired into real training loops.
- Serialization: FeedforwardNetwork.save/load is stubbed (load throws).
- Self‚Äëplay ‚Äúconcurrency‚Äù: Batched sequential execution with simulated concurrency.

Near‚Äëterm plan
- Replace simulated metrics with real batch metrics in pipeline (loss/entropy/grad‚Äënorm).  
- Centralize determinism (single run seed), thread through NN init, replay, and exploration; log in checkpoints.  
- Minimal JVM save/load for networks; checkpoint + resume.  
- Illegal‚Äëaction masking in DQN targets; maintain target sync cadence.  
- Standardize logging/metrics and benchmark flags for reproducibility.

#### Lightweight Logger and Metrics Export
- Use `Log` for simple, consistent logs with levels.
```kotlin
import com.chessrl.integration.logging.Log

Log.setLevel(Log.Level.INFO)
Log.info("Starting training‚Ä¶")
Log.debug("Buffer size=\${metrics.experienceBufferSize}")
```

- Standardize and export metrics (CSV/NDJSON) with `MetricsStandardizer` and `MetricsExporter`.
```kotlin
import com.chessrl.integration.metrics.*

val rec = MetricsStandardizer.fromEpisodeMetrics(episode.metrics, tags = mapOf("run" to "expA"))
MetricsExporter.writeCsv("out/metrics.csv", listOf(rec))
MetricsExporter.writeJsonLines("out/metrics.ndjson", listOf(rec), append = true)
```

### üöÄ **Advanced Self-Play Training** (Task 9.2 Complete)

- ‚úÖ **Performance Tests**: Large-scale training scenario validation and optimization

#### Checkpoint Resume Helpers
Use these helpers to restore the main agent from saved checkpoints in the advanced pipeline.

```kotlin
// Initialize advanced pipeline
val pipeline = AdvancedSelfPlayTrainingPipeline()
check(pipeline.initialize())

// Load the best checkpoint found so far (if any)
val loadedBest = pipeline.loadBestCheckpoint()
println("Loaded best checkpoint: $loadedBest")

// Or load a specific checkpoint version
val loadedV5 = pipeline.loadCheckpointVersion(5)
println("Loaded version 5: $loadedV5")

// Continue training after restoring weights
val results = pipeline.runAdvancedTraining(totalCycles = 3)
println("Training resumed. Best model version: ${results.bestModelVersion}")
```

Notes:
- Checkpoints are created automatically (initial, best, periodic) under `AdvancedSelfPlayConfig.checkpointDirectory`.
- On JVM, `FeedforwardNetwork.save/load` uses real file I/O. Native save/load is not yet implemented.

#### DQN Action Masking (Illegal Moves)
Masking ensures DQN targets only consider valid next-state actions when computing `max_a' Q(s', a')`.

Behavior:
- If a provider is set, DQN uses `validNextActions = provider(nextState)` to mask illegal actions in target computation.
- If no provider is set, it falls back to unmasked max over the full action space.

Integration default:
- `ChessTrainingPipeline` automatically sets the provider to `environment::getValidActions`, so masking works out of the box.

Custom environments or manual wiring:
```kotlin
// If you manage the agent/algorithm directly, provide the valid-actions function once.
// Via agent (preferred):
agent.setNextActionProvider { nextState -> myEnv.getValidActions(nextState) }

// Or if you access the underlying DQN algorithm directly:
// (only applicable when your agent exposes it)
// dqn.setNextActionProvider { nextState -> myEnv.getValidActions(nextState) }
```

#### DQN Target Sync Cadence
The DQN target network synchronizes with the main Q-network every `targetUpdateFrequency` updates and logs a short message when it happens.

- Log: `üîÅ DQN target network synchronized at update=<n> (freq=<k>)`
- Configure cadence when constructing DQN (integration defaults to 100):
```kotlin
val dqn = DQNAlgorithm(
    qNetwork = qNet,
    targetNetwork = tgtNet,
    experienceReplay = replay,
    gamma = 0.99,
    targetUpdateFrequency = 200, // sync every 200 updates
    batchSize = 64
)
```
Notes:
- Sync uses a best‚Äëeffort weight copy when the underlying networks support synchronization.
- The log helps verify cadence during debugging and tests.

## üìå Roadmap Snapshot (11.5‚Äì11.13)

- 11.8 Real Metrics [IMPORTANT, medium]: Wire true loss/entropy/grad‚Äënorm from batch training into pipeline; remove simulated metrics. DoD: pipeline reports match algorithm outputs; values are finite and trend meaningfully.
- 11.5 Determinism [IMPORTANT, fast]: Single run seed; thread through NN init, replay sampling, exploration; log with checkpoints. DoD: deterministic test mode and documented seed handling.
- 11.9 Checkpointing (JVM) [IMPORTANT, medium]: Implement FeedforwardNetwork save/load (config + weights) and integrate with CheckpointManager. DoD: save‚Üíload roundtrip and resume training.
- 11.11 Buffer API Cleanup [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Remove duplicate agent buffer for off‚Äëpolicy; use algorithm replay as source of truth; keep per‚Äëepisode buffer only for on‚Äëpolicy. DoD: no duplicate growth paths.
- 11.6 Logging & Metrics [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Lightweight logger + standardized metric keys/units; optional CSV/JSON dumps. DoD: consistent logs and exportable snapshots.
- 11.7 Benchmark Standardization [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Pin JVM flags, add warmup, record HW/JDK metadata. DoD: reproducible outputs with metadata.
- 11.12 Safety Checks [IMPROVEMENT, fast]: Stronger require/check on dims, masks, rewards; fail fast. DoD: clearer errors in edge cases.
- 11.13 Baseline Opponent [ADDITION, medium]: Simple material+mobility heuristic for evaluation runs. DoD: baseline win/draw/loss metrics separate from self‚Äëplay.

Notes
- We trimmed legacy UI/demo tests and added fast smoke tests (DQN learning, invalid‚Äëaction penalty). Performance tests are scaled down for CI.
