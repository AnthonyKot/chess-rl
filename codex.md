# RL4J Backend Refactor — Status (2025-03-10)

## What’s Done
- **RL4JChessAgent** now uses native builders:
  - Builds `QLearningDiscreteDense` with `ChessMDP`, `DQNFactoryStdDense`, `RL4JConfigurationMapper`.
  - Keeps typed references (`QLearningDiscreteDense<ChessObservation>`, `DQNPolicy<ChessObservation>`, `IDQN`).
  - Training is triggered via `train()` once; manual replay plumbing removed.
  - `trainBatch()` simply ensures initialization, runs `train()` once (cached), and surfaces RL4J metrics via a custom `TrainingListener`.
  - `learn(experience)` is a no-op; RL4J handles experience internally.
  - `getQValues` uses `neuralNet.output(..)` to produce logits; helper to convert `INDArray` to double array.
  - Mock/random policy fallback removed; agent fails fast if RL4J classes are unavailable.

- **RL4JConfigurationMapper**:
  - Maps `ChessAgentConfig` + optional `BackendConfig` to `QLearning.QLConfiguration` and `DQNDenseNetworkConfiguration` (uses Adam updater).
  - Adds parameter validation (batchSize, bufferSize, gamma range, epsilon clamping) and warning list.
  - Marked with `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")` (pending migration to newer RL4J configs).

- **BackendAwareChessAgentFactory**:
  - RL4J path now instantiates `RL4JChessAgent(config, backendConfig)` directly (no reflection).
  - `@Suppress("UNUSED_PARAMETER")` kept for unused knobs (double DQN/replayType). Manual/DL4J paths untouched (use `gamma`, `seedManager`).

- **RL4JLearningBackend**:
  - Simplified session: first `trainOnBatch()` call triggers RL4J training via `trainBatch(emptyList())`; subsequent calls reuse cached result.
  - Opponent synced by exploration rate; save checkpoints delegate to agent.
- **Integration Tests & Docs**:
  - RL4J tests run automatically when the backend is enabled (default) and skip themselves otherwise.
  - README documents JDK requirements and how to disable/enable the RL4J suite.

- **Cleanups**:
  - Removed unused locals in agent, redundant safe-calls, reflection utilities (`trainStep`, `store`, etc.).
  - Added `@Suppress("DEPRECATION")` to agent/mapper.
  - Logging trimmed to reflect new flow; ChessMDP now tracks per-episode illegal-action metrics and enriches `StepReply` info while exposing a legal-action mask via `ChessObservation`.

## Outstanding Questions / Gaps
- `RL4JChessAgent.trainBatch` currently ignores provided experiences and does a single `learn()` call (offline training). Need to confirm desired behaviour: repeated calls? multi-epoch support? ability to resume training with additional data?
- Metrics reporting is placeholder (`loss=0.0`, etc.). Need to hook RL4J `TrainingListener` to gather real training info (episode reward, epsilon, loss).
- `RL4JLearningBackend` still constructs two agents via factory (main/opponent). Opponent currently identical to main; consider whether opponent needs separate policy (for evaluation) or can reuse main policy.
- ChessMDP fallback remains, but policy-level masking now has a hook via `ChessObservation` masks (still unused by RL policy).
- RL4J metrics now come from listener snapshots; still need richer stats (loss gradients, TD error) when RL4J exposes them.
- Need to ensure `ChessAgentConfig` fields (learningRate, gamma, etc.) are populated consistently wherever RL4J backend is requested.

## Next Steps (Tomorrow)
1. **Metrics & Listeners**
   - Attach an RL4J `TrainingListener` to collect loss, score, epsilon from `QLearningDiscreteDense`.
   - Update `RL4JChessAgent.trainBatch` to return meaningful `PolicyUpdateResult` and update `ChessAgentMetrics`.

2. **Training Control**
   - Decide on training cadence: should `trainBatch` kick off a fresh RL4J training run each time, or only once? Document behaviour, possibly add guard for re-training.
   - Provide a way to resume/continue training (e.g., call `reset()` to retrain from scratch?).

3. **Testing**
   - Update / create RL4J integration tests to reflect the new flow (no manual experience injection).
   - Ensure CLI `--nn rl4j` path works end-to-end with an RL4J-enabled build.

4. **Cleanup**
   - Consider removing mock policy fallback; fail fast when RL4J classes unavailable (or keep purely for tests?).
   - Review logging now that progress counters are gone.

5. **Docs & README (later)**
   - Document the new behaviour: RL4J backend trains via `learn()`, what configuration knobs are honoured, how to run RL4J tests.
