## Performance Recommendations

### Development Environment

#### **Quick Iteration Cycle**
```bash
# Fast validation (2 seconds)
./gradlew integration:nativeTest --tests="*PerformanceBenchmark*"

# Core functionality (31 seconds)
./gradlew integration:nativeTest --tests="*ChessTrainingPipeline*"

# Full validation (4.5 minutes)
./gradlew integration:nativeTest
```

#### **Development Best Practices**
- Use Performance Benchmark tests for rapid feedback during development
- Run full test suite before commits to ensure comprehensive validation
- Monitor performance trends using the benchmark baseline times
- Consider incremental compilation optimizations for faster build times

### Production Deployment

#### **Optimal Configuration**
```kotlin
TrainingPipelineConfig(
    batchSize = 64,                    // Optimal for chess RL
    maxBufferSize = 50000,             // Balance memory vs performance
    batchTrainingFrequency = 1,        // Train every episode
    samplingStrategy = SamplingStrategy.MIXED,  // Best learning diversity
    progressReportInterval = 100       // Reasonable monitoring frequency
)
```

#### **Resource Requirements**
- **Memory**: 100-500MB depending on buffer size and network architecture
- **CPU**: Single-core sufficient for training, multi-core beneficial for parallel environments
- **Storage**: Minimal for checkpoints, scales with training duration

### CI/CD Pipeline Optimization
