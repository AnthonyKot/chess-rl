### 3. Enhanced Experience System

**EnhancedExperience Data Structure:**
```kotlin
data class EnhancedExperience(
    // Core experience data
    val state: DoubleArray,
    val action: Int,
    val reward: Double,
    val nextState: DoubleArray,
    val done: Boolean,
    
    // Enhanced metadata
    val gameId: Int,
    val moveNumber: Int,
    val playerColor: PieceColor,
    val gameOutcome: GameOutcome,
    val terminationReason: EpisodeTerminationReason,
    
    // Quality metrics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Concurrent Execution Architecture

**Design Approach:**
- Simulated concurrency for Kotlin/Native compatibility
