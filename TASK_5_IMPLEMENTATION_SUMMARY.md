# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Simplified and Reliable Architecture

## Overview

This document summarizes all changes made to implement Task 5: "Implement Simplified and Reliable Architecture". The implementation focused on creating a reliable, maintainable system that prioritizes stability over maximum performance while still providing significant performance improvements through multi-process parallelism.

## 1. Architecture Analysis and Decision (Subtask 5.0)
