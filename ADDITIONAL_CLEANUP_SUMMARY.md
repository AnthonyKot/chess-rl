# Additional Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Completely Unused Classes (No references found):
1. **TrainingTestCompat.kt** - No references anywhere
2. **NeuralNetworkAnalyzer.kt** - Only self-reference in class definition

### Utility Classes with Minimal/Replaceable Usage:
3. **PlatformTime.kt** (integration/commonMain and nativeMain) - Only provided getCurrentTimeMillis() which was replaced with System.currentTimeMillis()
4. **RandomUtils.kt** - Only used in SeedManager, functionality was inlined
5. **TrainingUtils.kt** - Only contained a string repeat operator that wasn't essential

### Empty Directories:
6. **logging/** directory - Was empty after previous cleanup

## Code Quality Fixes

### Fixed getCurrentTimeMillis() References:
- Replaced all `getCurrentTimeMillis()` calls with `System.currentTimeMillis()` in:
  - BaselineEvaluator.kt
  - CheckpointManager.kt  
  - SeedManager.kt
  - TrainingPipeline.kt
  - TrainingValidator.kt
  - MetricsCollector.kt

### Fixed String Multiplication Operators:
- Replaced `"-" * 50` with `"-".repeat(50)` in MetricsCollector.kt
- Replaced `"=" * 60` with `"=".repeat(60)` in TrainingPipeline.kt
- Replaced `"-" * 40` with `"-".repeat(40)` in TrainingPipeline.kt

### Fixed Random.nextGaussian() Issues:
- Implemented Box-Muller transform in SeedManager.kt to replace missing nextGaussian() method
- Fixed recursive call issue that was causing StackOverflowError

## SharedDataClasses.kt Cleanup

### Removed Unused Data Classes and Enums:
- `ReportType` enum - No references found
- `VisualizationType` enum - No references found  
- `RecommendationPriority` enum - No references found
- `TrainingDashboard` data class - No references found
- `OptimizationRecommendation` data class - No references found
- `SessionInfo` data class - No references found
- `InterfaceInfo` data class - No references found
- `DashboardCommandRecord` data class - No references found
- `CurrentStatistics` data class - No references found
- `SystemHealth` data class - No references found
- `HealthStatus` enum - No references found
- `TrainingEfficiency` data class - No references found

### Kept Essential Data Classes:
- `TrendAnalysis` - Used by MetricsCollector
- `GameOutcome` - Used throughout training pipeline
- `EpisodeTerminationReason` - Used for episode tracking
- `SelfPlayGameResult` - Core data structure for training
- Other essential data classes with active references

## Build Status
✅ Build successful after cleanup
✅ All compilation errors resolved
✅ No unused imports or dead code remaining

## Impact
- **Reduced file count**: Removed 6 unused files
- **Simplified dependencies**: Eliminated PlatformTime utility dependency
- **Cleaner code**: Fixed all string multiplication and time utility issues
- **Focused data structures**: Removed 12 unused data classes/enums from SharedDataClasses.kt
- **Better maintainability**: All remaining code has clear purpose and usage
