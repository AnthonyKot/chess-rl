```
Main Process (Coordinator)
├── Load best model version
├── Spawn N worker processes
├── Collect results from workers
└── Train on aggregated experiences

Worker Process 1..N

- [ ] Workers use same model version (no mid-training updates needed)
- [ ] No shared state required during self-play phase
- [ ] Experience aggregation can happen after all games complete
- [ ] Process overhead acceptable vs thread complexity

### Comparison Matrix
| Aspect | Coroutines | Multi-Process | Single-Process |
