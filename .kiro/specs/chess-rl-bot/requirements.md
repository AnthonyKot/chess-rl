# Requirements Document - Chess RL Bot Refactoring

## Introduction

This refactoring effort aims to transform the current chess RL bot codebase from an experimental research prototype with accumulated technical debt into a clean, reliable, effective, and configurable system. The current codebase has become messy due to experiments and feature flags, making it difficult to maintain and understand.

The core goal is to refactor the repository so that it focuses solely on training a chess self-play RL agent (DQN + NN) that can perform as well as baseline/minimax algorithms, while eliminating all unnecessary complexity, dead code, and ineffective features that don't contribute to this objective.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Comprehensive Codebase Audit

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to conduct a thorough audit of all feature flags, configurations, and workflows in the chess RL codebase, so that I can categorize them into essential vs removable components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing the codebase THEN it SHALL identify and catalog all feature flags, boolean configurations, and experimental workflows
2. WHEN analyzing configurations THEN it SHALL examine profiles.yaml, TrainingConfiguration, CLI flags, and environment variables
3. WHEN categorizing features THEN it SHALL classify each component as: Essential (core training), Useful (performance/debugging), or Removable (experimental/dead code)
4. WHEN documenting findings THEN it SHALL create a comprehensive inventory of all flags and their current usage
5. WHEN evaluating impact THEN it SHALL assess which features actually contribute to training agents competitive with baseline/minimax
6. IF a feature flag or configuration has no measurable impact on agent performance THEN it SHALL be marked for removal

### Requirement 2 - Clean Architecture Design

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to propose a cleaner module/package structure that defines core vs optional components, so that the system has clear separation of concerns and minimal redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the architecture THEN it SHALL propose a clean module structure with well-defined boundaries
2. WHEN defining core components THEN it SHALL identify the minimal set of packages needed for chess RL training
3. WHEN eliminating redundancy THEN it SHALL merge duplicate implementations and remove overlapping functionality
4. WHEN organizing modules THEN it SHALL ensure each package has a single, clear responsibility
5. WHEN defining interfaces THEN it SHALL create clean abstractions that support testing without over-engineering
6. IF a module or class doesn't have a clear, essential purpose THEN it SHALL be removed or consolidated

### Requirement 3 - Central Configuration System

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to replace the current scattered flags and configurations with a central config system, so that configuration is simple, consistent, and focused on parameters that matter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the config system THEN it SHALL replace scattered flags with a single, centralized configuration approach
2. WHEN consolidating parameters THEN it SHALL keep only configuration options that have measurable impact on training effectiveness
3. WHEN creating config profiles THEN it SHALL provide 2-3 well-tested profiles: development, production, and evaluation
4. WHEN implementing config parsing THEN it SHALL use Kotlin best practices for configuration management
5. WHEN validating configurations THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and sensible defaults
6. IF a configuration parameter doesn't significantly affect agent performance or training reliability THEN it SHALL be removed

### Requirement 4 - Reliable Training Pipeline

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to ensure the training pipeline is reliable with fewer bugs and consistent behavior, so that chess RL training produces predictable and competitive results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN improving reliability THEN it SHALL eliminate flaky training behaviors and inconsistent results
2. WHEN consolidating training logic THEN it SHALL merge redundant training implementations into a single, well-tested approach
3. WHEN implementing best practices THEN it SHALL use Kotlin coroutines for concurrent self-play and proper error handling
4. WHEN ensuring consistency THEN it SHALL make training results reproducible and deterministic when needed
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN it SHALL focus on proven approaches that reliably train competitive agents
6. IF a training component introduces instability or doesn't improve agent competitiveness THEN it SHALL be removed or fixed

### Requirement 5 - Essential Test Suite Design

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to identify essential unit/integration/regression tests and propose missing tests, so that chess logic, RL loop, and evaluation correctness are guaranteed without test suite bloat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing tests THEN it SHALL identify which tests are essential for core functionality validation
2. WHEN removing flaky tests THEN it SHALL eliminate performance-sensitive and environment-dependent tests that cause CI failures
3. WHEN ensuring coverage THEN it SHALL verify that chess rules, neural network training, and RL algorithms have reliable tests
4. WHEN identifying gaps THEN it SHALL propose missing tests needed to ensure chess logic and evaluation stay correct
5. WHEN optimizing test suite THEN it SHALL focus on fast, reliable tests that catch regressions in core functionality
6. IF a test is flaky, slow, or tests removed functionality THEN it SHALL be eliminated or rewritten

### Requirement 6 - Code Cleanup and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to recommend specific flags, scripts, and workflows to delete or archive, and suggest Kotlin best practices, so that the codebase follows maintainability standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommending cleanup THEN it SHALL provide specific lists of flags, scripts, and workflows to delete or archive
2. WHEN suggesting best practices THEN it SHALL recommend Kotlin improvements like coroutines for self-play, proper config parsing, and structured logging
3. WHEN improving maintainability THEN it SHALL suggest code organization improvements and eliminate technical debt
4. WHEN removing dead code THEN it SHALL identify and eliminate commented-out code, debug prints, and experimental remnants
5. WHEN standardizing style THEN it SHALL ensure consistent Kotlin idioms and naming conventions
6. IF code doesn't follow Kotlin best practices or contains obsolete experimental features THEN it SHALL be refactored or removed

### Requirement 7 - Effective Feature Focus

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to ensure the system contains no wasted features or dead flags, so that every component contributes meaningfully to training agents competitive with baseline/minimax algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating effectiveness THEN it SHALL measure which features actually improve agent performance against baseline opponents
2. WHEN removing waste THEN it SHALL eliminate features that don't contribute to the core goal of competitive chess play
3. WHEN consolidating algorithms THEN it SHALL focus on the RL approaches that have proven most effective for chess
4. WHEN optimizing workflows THEN it SHALL keep only the training and evaluation workflows that produce measurable improvements
5. WHEN measuring success THEN it SHALL use agent performance against minimax/heuristic baselines as the primary effectiveness metric
6. IF a feature doesn't help train agents that can compete with traditional chess algorithms THEN it SHALL be removed

### Requirement 8 - Comprehensive Refactoring Roadmap

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want a detailed step-by-step refactoring roadmap with proposed architecture and action plans, so that the refactoring can be executed systematically and successfully.

### Requirement 9 - Baseline Competitive Validation

5. WHEN validating chess knowledge THEN it SHALL verify that trained agents demonstrate sound chess principles and tactics
6. IF the refactored system cannot train agents competitive with traditional chess algorithms THEN the refactoring approach SHALL be reconsidered

### Requirement 10 - Success Metrics and Validation
