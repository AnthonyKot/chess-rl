# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a production-ready reinforcement learning system that enables a bot to learn chess through self-play. The system is built using Kotlin Multiplatform with JVM optimization for training performance and consists of four modular components:

1. **Neural Network Package**: A comprehensive neural network library with advanced training features
2. **Chess Engine**: A complete chess game implementation with full rule support
3. **RL Framework**: A flexible reinforcement learning framework supporting multiple algorithms
4. **Integration Layer**: A chess-specific RL integration with comprehensive training pipeline

The system uses advanced RL techniques (DQN, Policy Gradient) to train agents through self-play, with sophisticated training validation, debugging tools, and performance monitoring. Based on implementation experience, the system prioritizes JVM performance for training workloads while maintaining native compilation capability for deployment scenarios.
