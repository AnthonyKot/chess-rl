# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a simplified reinforcement learning algorithm that enables a bot to learn chess through self-play. The system will be built using Kotlin with native image compilation support and consists of three modular components:

1. **RL Microframework**: A reusable reinforcement learning framework
2. **Chess Implementation**: A chess game engine with API that could be extended for human play
3. **Neural Network Package**: A custom neural network library suitable for training and integration with the RL framework

The system will use basic RL techniques to train an agent that can play chess against itself, gradually improving its gameplay through experience and learning from wins, losses, and draws.
