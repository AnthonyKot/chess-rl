# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a pluggable neural network backend system that allows the Chess RL Training System to use different neural network implementations (manual FeedforwardNetwork, DL4J, or KotlinDL) while maintaining the existing RL algorithm interfaces. The system provides backend selection via CLI flags or configuration files, enabling performance comparison and library validation without disrupting current training workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to switch between different neural network backends (manual, DL4J, KotlinDL) for my RL training, so that I can compare performance and leverage optimized library implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify `--nn manual` in CLI arguments THEN the system SHALL use the existing FeedforwardNetwork implementation
2. WHEN I specify `--nn dl4j` in CLI arguments THEN the system SHALL use the DL4J library backend
3. WHEN I specify `--nn kotlindl` in CLI arguments THEN the system SHALL use the KotlinDL library backend
4. IF no neural network backend is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the manual implementation
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate the selected backend and report any initialization errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized neural network adapter interfaces, so that I can add new NN backends without modifying the RL algorithm code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new NN adapter THEN it SHALL implement NeuralNetwork, TrainableNeuralNetwork, and SynchronizableNetwork interfaces
2. WHEN calling forward() THEN the adapter SHALL accept 839-dimensional input and return 4096-dimensional output
3. WHEN calling trainBatch() THEN the adapter SHALL accept batch data and perform gradient updates
4. WHEN calling copyWeightsTo() THEN the adapter SHALL synchronize weights to target networks
5. WHEN calling save(path) and load(path) THEN the adapter SHALL persist and restore complete network state including optimizer state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trainer, I want the DQN algorithm to work identically regardless of the neural network backend used, so that my training results are consistent and comparable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any NN backend THEN the DQN algorithm SHALL maintain identical behavior for action selection and training
2. WHEN performing target network synchronization THEN all backends SHALL produce equivalent weight copying
3. WHEN calculating Q-values THEN all backends SHALL return finite values in the same numerical range
4. WHEN applying action masking THEN the masking logic SHALL work consistently across all backends
5. WHEN logging training metrics THEN loss, entropy, and gradient norms SHALL be reported identically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic backend validation and error handling, so that training doesn't fail due to backend-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a backend is selected THEN the system SHALL validate it can perform forward passes with correct output dimensions
2. WHEN a backend fails validation THEN the system SHALL report specific error details and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN training encounters NaN or infinite values THEN the system SHALL log warnings and attempt recovery
4. WHEN save/load operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with file paths
5. WHEN memory allocation fails THEN the system SHALL report memory requirements and suggest configuration changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want neural network backend benchmarking, so that I can choose the optimal backend for my training workload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN benchmarking forward passes THEN the system SHALL measure average inference time per batch
2. WHEN benchmarking training THEN the system SHALL measure average time per gradient update
3. WHEN comparing backends THEN the system SHALL provide timing results and memory usage statistics
4. WHEN running benchmarks THEN the system SHALL use identical network architectures and batch sizes
5. WHEN benchmarks complete THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports with backend-specific metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want save/load compatibility across backends, so that I can switch backends without losing trained models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN saving models THEN each backend SHALL use appropriate file formats (JSON for manual, ZIP for DL4J)
2. WHEN loading models THEN the system SHALL detect file format and route to correct backend
3. WHEN switching backends THEN the system SHALL provide conversion utilities where possible
4. WHEN checkpoint resolution occurs THEN the system SHALL check for both .json and .zip files based on existence
5. WHEN save/load round-trips complete THEN model outputs SHALL match within numerical tolerance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable network architectures, so that I can tune hyperparameters for different backends through configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring hidden layers THEN the system SHALL accept layer size specifications in profile files
2. WHEN setting learning rates THEN each backend SHALL apply the configured optimizer learning rate
3. WHEN specifying regularization THEN L2 penalty SHALL be configurable per backend
4. WHEN choosing loss functions THEN the system SHALL support Huber loss and MSE options
5. WHEN using profiles THEN nnBackend configuration SHALL override CLI flags

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a trainer, I want thread-safe neural network operations, so that concurrent training and evaluation can proceed safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing concurrent inference THEN each thread SHALL use separate input arrays to avoid conflicts
2. WHEN training occurs THEN gradient updates SHALL be synchronized to prevent race conditions
3. WHEN target network sync happens THEN weight copying SHALL be atomic and thread-safe
4. WHEN save/load operations execute THEN they SHALL not interfere with ongoing training
5. WHEN using DL4J backend THEN training SHALL be funneled through single thread or properly synchronized

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want proper dependency management, so that neural network libraries are included without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using DL4J backend THEN the system SHALL include deeplearning4j-core and nd4j-native-platform dependencies
2. WHEN using KotlinDL backend THEN the system SHALL include appropriate KotlinDL dependencies
3. WHEN building the project THEN dependency conflicts SHALL be resolved automatically
4. WHEN running on different platforms THEN native libraries SHALL be available for the target platform
5. WHEN libraries are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with installation instructions

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing for all neural network backends, so that I can verify correctness and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN each adapter SHALL pass forward pass shape validation and finite output checks
2. WHEN testing training THEN batch loss SHALL decrease on synthetic data for all backends
3. WHEN testing save/load THEN round-trip operations SHALL preserve model state within tolerance
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN DQN training SHALL complete without invalid moves for all backends
5. WHEN running CI THEN all backend tests SHALL pass and performance SHALL not regress significantly
