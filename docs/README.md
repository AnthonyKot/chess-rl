## System Overview

The Chess RL Bot consists of four modular Kotlin packages:

- **Neural Network Package** (`nn-package`): Advanced neural networks with comprehensive training features
- **Chess Engine** (`chess-engine`): Complete chess implementation with full rule support
- **RL Framework** (`rl-framework`): Flexible reinforcement learning framework
- **Integration Layer** (`integration`): Chess-specific RL integration with production pipeline

## Key Features

- âœ… **Production Ready**: 166+ tests, comprehensive error handling, monitoring
- âš¡ **High Performance**: JVM-optimized training (5-8x faster than native)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Advanced RL**: DQN and Policy Gradient algorithms with self-play
- ðŸ”§ **Comprehensive Tools**: Training validation, debugging, and analysis tools
- ðŸ“ˆ **Scalable**: Efficient batch processing, memory management, concurrent training

## Support

- **Issues**: Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting/README.md)
- **Performance**: See [Performance Optimization](analysis/performance-benchmarks.md)
- **Development**: Follow the [Developer Guide](developer-guide/README.md)
